"Beans & Bargains" Price Checker Apps Prototype

# About The Project
Our project is based on the problem of user difficulty in differentiating the price of different products from different stores. There are many stores in Malaysia and each store has different prices and has different promotions on certain products. Malaysia's retail landscape includes a diverse range of shopping venues, from massive shopping malls and department stores. With so many items at different prices, it is quite difficult to differentiate prices from different stores.
